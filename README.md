# TensorFlow-Keras-Regressor
The pretrained model 'ResNet50' is retrained to predict people age from their image faces, this is, the regression problem is solved for face images.

## Details
* The model is stored in Hugging Face, use the following link to download it:

www

* In folder "notebooks" are the Jupyter Notebooks used to train the model.
* In folder "test" are some images to test the model.
* The Jupyter Notebook "make_regression_predictions.ipynb" shows how to make predictions with the trained model. This model should be downloaded and saved in folder 'models' as 'model_face.h5'.

## üöÄ How to run locally
1. Clone the corresponding Hugging Face repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/arteaga7/TensorFlow-Keras-Regressor.git
```
2. Set virtual environment and install dependencies:
```
python3 -m venv env && source env/bin/activate && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run "notebooks/make_regression_predictions.ipynb".

## üéØ Results
After running "notebooks/make_regression_predictions.ipynb", the following results were obtained.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 10.5, Mean Squared Error (MSE): 243.83 and R^2 Score: 0.15.

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Conclution
The MAE (Mean Absolute Error) is acceptable. The performance of the model is related to the dataset quality, pretrained model used (Resnet50), convolutional neuronal network design and batch size of training. Due to limitations in computing power, this model could not be trained better.
